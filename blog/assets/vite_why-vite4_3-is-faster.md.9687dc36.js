To let more people know what we did to make Vite 4.3 so fast, we are happy to share the experience.</p><h2 id="smarter-resolve-strategy" tabindex="-1">Smarter resolve strategy <a class="header-anchor" href="#smarter-resolve-strategy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Smarter resolve strategy&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>Vite resolves all the received URLs and paths to get the target modules.</p><p>In Vite 4.2, there are many <strong>redundant resolve logics and unnecessary module searches</strong>. Vite 4.3 makes the resolve logic <strong>simpler</strong>, <strong>stricter</strong> and <strong>more accurate</strong> to reduce calculations and <code>fs</code> calls.</p><h3 id="a-simpler-resolve" tabindex="-1">A simpler resolve <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-simpler-resolve" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A simpler resolve&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>Vite 4.2 heavily depends on the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">resolve</a> package to resolve the dependency&#39;s <code>package.json</code>, when we looked into the source code of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">resolve</a>, there was much useless logic while resolving <code>package.json</code>. Vite 4.3 abandons <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">resolve</a> and follows the simpler resolve logic: directly checks whether <code>package.json</code> exists in the nested parents&#39; directories.</p><h3 id="a-stricter-resolve" tabindex="-1">A stricter resolve <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-stricter-resolve" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A stricter resolve&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>Vite has to call the Nodejs <code>fs</code> APIs to find the module. But IO is expensive. Vite 4.3 narrows the file search and skips searching some special paths in order to reduce the <code>fs</code> calls as much as possible. e.g:</p><ol><li>Since <code>#</code> symbol would not appear in URLs and users could control that no <code>#</code> symbol in the source files&#39; paths, Vite 4.3 no longer checks paths with <code>#</code> symbol inside the user&#39;s source files but only searches them in the <code>node_modules</code>.</li><li>In Unix systems, Vite 4.2 checks each absolute path inside the root directory first, it&#39;s fine for most paths, but it would be very likely to fail if the absolute path starts with the root. To skip searching <code>/root/root/path-to-file</code> while <code>/root/root</code> doesn&#39;t exist, Vite 4.3 judges whether <code>/root/root</code> exists as a directory at the beginning and pre-caches the result.</li><li>When Vite server receives <code>@fs/xxx</code> and <code>@vite/xxx</code>, it would be unnecessary to resolve these URLs again. Vite 4.3 directly returns the previously cached result instead of re-resolving them.</li></ol><h3 id="a-more-accurate-resolve" tabindex="-1">A more accurate resolve <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-more-accurate-resolve" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A more accurate resolve&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>Vite 4.2 recursively resolves the module when the file path is a directory, this would lead to unnecessary calculations repeatedly. Vite 4.3 flattens the recursive resolution and applies appropriate resolution to different types of paths. It&#39;s also easier to cache some <code>fs</code> calls after flattening.</p><h3 id="package-package-package" tabindex="-1">Package package package <a class="header-anchor" href="#package-package-package" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Package package package&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/bluwy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@bluwy</a>&#39;s nice work, Vite 4.3 breaks the performance bottleneck of resolving <code>node_modules</code> package data.</p><p>Vite 4.2 uses absolute file paths as the package data cache keys. That&#39;s not enough since Vite has to traverse the same directory both in <code>pkg/foo/bar</code> and <code>pkg/foo/baz</code>. <br>Vite 4.3 uses not only the absolute paths(<code>/root/node_modules/pkg/foo/bar.js</code> &amp; <code>/root/node_modules/pkg/foo/baz.js</code>) but also the traversed directories(<code>/root/node_modules/pkg/foo</code> &amp; <code>/root/node_modules/pkg</code>) as the keys of <code>pkg</code> cache.</p><p>Another case is that Vite 4.2 looks up <code>package.json</code> of a deep import path inside a single function, e.g when Vite 4.2 resolves a file path like <code>a/b/c/d</code>, it first checks whether root <code>a/package.json</code> exists, if not, then finds the nearest <code>package.json</code> in the order <code>a/b/c/package.json</code> -&gt; <code>a/b/package.json</code>, but the fact is that finding root <code>package.json</code> and nearest <code>package.json</code> should be handled separately since they are needed in different resolve contexts. Vite 4.3 splits the root <code>package.json</code> and nearest <code>package.json</code> resolution in two parts so that they won&#39;t mix.</p><h2 id="fs-realpathsync-issue" tabindex="-1"><code>fs.realpathSync</code> issue <a class="header-anchor" href="#fs-realpathsync-issue" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;`fs.realpathSync` issue&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>There was an interesting <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2680" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>realpathSync</code> issue</a> in Nodejs, it pointed out that <code>fs.realpathSync</code> is 70x slower than <code>fs.realpathSync.native</code>.</p><p>But Vite 4.2 only uses <code>fs.realpathSync.native</code> on non-Windows systems due to its <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/37737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">different behavior on Windows</a>. To fix that, Vite 4.3 adds a network drive validation when calling <code>fs.realpathSync.native</code> on Windows.</p><p>You can check more details <a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/12580" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Vite never gives up on Windows ðŸ”¥</p></blockquote><h2 id="non-blocking-tasks" tabindex="-1">Non-blocking tasks <a class="header-anchor" href="#non-blocking-tasks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Non-blocking tasks&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>As an on-demand service, Vite dev server can be started without all the stuff being ready.</p><h3 id="non-blocking-tsconfig-parsing" tabindex="-1">Non-blocking <code>tsconfig</code> parsing <a class="header-anchor" href="#non-blocking-tsconfig-parsing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Non-blocking `tsconfig` parsing&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>Vite server needs <code>tsconfig</code> data when pre-bundling <code>ts</code> or <code>tsx</code>.</p><p>Vite 4.2 waits for <code>tsconfig</code> data to be parsed in the plugin hook <code>configResolved</code> before the server starts up. Page requests could visit the server once the server starts up without <code>tsconfig</code> data ready even though the request might need to wait for the <code>tsconfig</code> parsing later.</p><p>Vite 4.3 inits <code>tsconfig</code> parsing before the server starts up, but the server won&#39;t wait for it. The parsing process runs in the background. Once a <code>ts</code>-related request comes in, it will have to wait until the <code>tsconfig</code> parsing is finished.</p><h3 id="non-blocking-file-processing" tabindex="-1">Non-blocking file processing <a class="header-anchor" href="#non-blocking-file-processing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Non-blocking file processing&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>There are plenty of <code>fs</code> calls in Vite, and some of them are synchronous. These synchronous <code>fs</code> calls may block the main thread. Vite 4.3 changes them to asynchronous. Also, it&#39;s easier to parallelize the asynchronous functions. One thing about asynchronous functions you should care about is that there might be many <code>Promise</code> objects to be released after they are resolved. Thanks to the smarter resolve strategy, the cost of releasing <code>fs</code>-<code>Promise</code> objects is much less.</p><h2 id="hmr-debouncing" tabindex="-1">HMR debouncing <a class="header-anchor" href="#hmr-debouncing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;HMR debouncing&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>Consider two simple dependency chains <code>C &lt;- B &lt;- A</code> &amp; <code>D &lt;- B &lt;- A</code>, when <code>A</code> is edited, HMR will propagate both from <code>A</code> to <code>C</code> and <code>A</code> to <code>D</code>. This leads to <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> being updated twice in Vite 4.2.</p><p>Vite 4.3 caches these traversed modules to avoid exploring them multiple times. This could have a big impact on those file structures with components barrel importing. It&#39;s also good for HMR triggered by <code>git checkout</code>.</p><h2 id="parallelization" tabindex="-1">Parallelization <a class="header-anchor" href="#parallelization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Parallelization&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>Parallelization is always a good choice for better performance. In Vite 4.3, we parallelized some core features includes <a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/12754/files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">imports analysis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/12869/files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">extract deps&#39; exports</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/12619/files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">resolve module urls</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/12609/files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">run bulk optimizers</a>.

We compared <code>str.startsWith(&#39;x&#39;)</code>&#39;s and <code>str[0] === &#39;x&#39;</code>&#39;s execution benchmarks and found <code>===</code> was about ~20% faster than <code>startsWith</code>.
